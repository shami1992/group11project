# group11project

This is the repository for our final project. Good luck everyone!

## Topic

This project is regarding voice recognition. More specifically, to identify the speaker’s gender by analyzing a short voice input. Reason of selecting this topic is to understand how to quantify the characteristics of each gender’s voice. It is easy for a human to distinguish the speaker’s gender, yet it is hard to tell how human achieved this ability. Level of difficulty is also a reason we choose this topic. This is a classification problem instead of a regression problem, which means a relatively manageable difficulty, at our level of understanding on machine learning. Meanwhile, there are available dataset in Kaggle consisting of tens of thousands voice sample as well as gender label.
The dataset includes voice samples of speaker as well as the gender label associated with the sample.
The questions we hope to answer is what is the gender of speaker when we have a sample of the voice.
